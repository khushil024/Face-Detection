# Face-Detection-
An Image Classification model using Siamese network fed to a sigmoid unit for a logistic regression problem. Data pre-processing involves face detection and localization and extracting faces to create a data frame with random pairing combinations. For this face localization MTCNN network is used. Final prediction notebook will need model weights(Siamese_Net.h5), class_images.pickle, names.pickle which are provided in the following drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KCQkQZjzKshLIeqevHyNVHtXLUUgoO8Q?usp=sharing
